      summary: Update attachment data
      description: "Updates the binary data of an attachment, given the attachment
        ID, and \noptionally the comment and the minor edit field.\n\nThis method
        is essentially the same as [Create or update attachments](#api-content-id-child-attachment-put),
        \nexcept that it matches the attachment ID rather than the name.\n\nNote,
        you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on the request \nfor this
        method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects against XSRF \nattacks,
        which is necessary as this method accepts multipart/form-data.\n\nThe media
        type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC 1867](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt).
        \nMost client libraries have classes that make it easier to implement \nmultipart
        posts, like the [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html)
        \nJava class provided by Apache HTTP Components.\n\nExample: This curl command
        updates an attachment (id='att456') that is attached  \nto a piece of content
        (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true. \n\n``` bash\ncurl -D- \\\n
        \ -u admin:admin \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H \"X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck\" \\\n
        \ -F \"file=@example.txt\" \\\n  -F \"minorEdit=true\" \\\n  -F \"comment=Example
        attachment comment\" \\\n  http://myhost/rest/api/content/123/child/attachment/att456/data\n```\n**[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw)
        required**: \nPermission to update the content."
